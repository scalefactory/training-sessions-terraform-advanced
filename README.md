## Notes

  - Dynamo table created in the bootstrap for duplicate resource on on dynamodb
    - Students must import existing table

  - Lambda initially created with read only role
    - Students will need to fix role name

  - An example module for lambda into for state move example
    - Students will make their own module and do the state move, this module
      is for us to prove the course

  - Template file example, HTML report of basic resource stuff, make available
    by public S3 bucket website

  - Keep public block examples, they don't even need to interact with these,
    just good to have them there to call them out
