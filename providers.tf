# The %%ACCOUNT_ID%% here will want to be replaced with your assigned AWS account ID.
# You can do this with the following command once you know your account ID:
#
# sed -i 's/%%ACCOUNT_ID%%/123456789012/g' providers.tf
#
# For Mac users
# sed -i .bak 's/%%ACCOUNT_ID%%/123456789012/g' providers.tf

# Where 123456789012 is your real account ID.
